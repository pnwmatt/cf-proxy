> Proxy requests through Cloudflare (CF) workers

A simple worker that acts as proxy to tunnel requests over the internet, forwarding them through Cloudflare's global 
network of servers. This way, we can archieve automatic IP address rotation, all coming from a trusted ASN 
(as CF is used by a huge number of websites, their ASNs are usually whitelisted 
on firewalls :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:).

## Server Usage

1. Fork this project to your own github
2. Create a Cloudflare API Token with the following permissions:
   - Workers Agents Configuration (edit)
3. Create a random PROXY_TOKEN to authenticate proxy requests: `openssl rand -hex 24`
4. Store both the Cloudflare API Token and PROXY_TOKEN in your Password Manager
5. Optional: Use [ntfy.sh](https://ntfy.sh) for free to get success/failure deploy messages
6. Set up Github Actions Repository Secrets: [https://github.com/YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/cf-proxy/settings/secrets/actions/new](https://github.com/YOURGITHUBUSERNAME/cf-proxy/settings/secrets/actions/new)
   - CF_DEPLOY_TOKEN
   - CF_ACCOUNT_ID (36 hex code found in your dash.cloudflare.com url)
   - PROXY_TOKEN
   - NTFY_TOPIC (optional)

  (Remember: your NTFY topic is unsecured: anyone can read anything you post there)



## Client Usage

You will need [bun](https://bun.sh/) to run the client script `proxy.js`. You can install it by running:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
. ~/.bashrc
```

You also need a Cloudflare account to deploy the worker. A free account is fine, but you might experience some issues 
with page loading with slow website connections as the workers have a limitation of 10ms CPU time per request on the 
free tier, but as long as you don't try to download any big files this should be enough to navigate the internet.

Once you have bun installed, go ahead and install `wrangler` using:

```bash
bun i -g wrangler
```

Login to CF with `wrangler`:

```bash
wrangler login
```

Then, `cd` into `worker/` directory and install dependences with:

```bash
cd worker/
bun i
```

Now, edit the file at `src/index.js` to include an authorization token (necessary to avoid other people from using it). 
Just change the TOKEN constant value:

```javascript
5   const TOKEN = '<YOUR-AUTH-TOKEN>'
```

Now, you can deploy the worker with (on `worker/`)
```bash
wrangler deploy
```

You can run `bun proxy.js` (with no arguments) to see options:

```
proxy.js - Proxy requests through CloudFlare workers
Usage: bun proxy.js [options] <socks|http> <worker>

Options:

-h, --help         Show this help message and exit
-p, --port         Port to listen on
-a, --auth         Authorization header
-v, --verbose      Enable verbose mode (default: false)

Example: bun proxy.js -v -a auth-secret socks my-instance.workers.dev

```

The general usage options are `-a` (to provide the authorization token), followed by the type of proxy and the 
worker's address.

For example, lets suppose your worker instance has the address `myinstance.workers.dev`, with the auth token of 
`secret` (your CF token) and you want to run a SOCKS5 proxy server on port `1080` (default for SOCKS). 
This could be done with the following command:

> Make sure that you are in the root project directory.

```bash
cd ..
bun proxy.js -a secret -p 1080 socks myinstance.workers.dev
```

Then configure your browser to use `127.0.0.1:1080` as a SOCKS5 proxy and enjoy the automatic ip address 
rotation :wink:.

For a http proxy, just change the type from `socks` to `http`, for example:

```bash
bun proxy.js -a secret -p 8080 http myinstance.workers.dev
```

> In order to confirm that your IP has changed. 
> You can easily see your request information on the CLI with:

```bash
curl -x localhost:8080 https://myip.wtf/json
```

> Or simply go to the address below on the URL bar. Remember to configure the proxy on the browser, 
> I suggest this extension [Foxy proxy standard](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/addon/foxyproxy-standard/) for easily switching between proxy configurations.

```

```

## Limitations

By default, Cloudflare doesn't allow connections to port 25 of any target. Also, connecting to Cloudflare 
address space from within a worker is not supported, so you might have problems accessing sites that are 
behind CF (there are some ways around it, but I will leave that as an exercise to the reader :smiley:).

## Notes

Your IP address will rotate at _each_ request, since the worker runs on the so-called serverless architecture, 
spawned in a distributed global network of servers owned by cloudflare. Each time you invoke a worker, a different 
server might be provisioned depending on the current availability. These servers might be located on your region 
(which is usually the case) or even in another country.

This project is just an example to showcase an application that I developed while learning javascript and 
[Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/). I'm not related to the company, nor I endorse or otherwise discourage 
the usage their services. And finally, this project is intended only for educational purposes and I won't be 
responsible for any bad actions or abuse of this service.
